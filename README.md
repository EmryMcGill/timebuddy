# Time Buddy

### Author: Emry McGill

## Description
A web app to keep track of the time you spend working on different things. You can create projects to track time for, take breaks, and view a report of the total time.

## Motivation
I like to track the time I spend on activities like studying and working on projects, so I created this tool to simplify the process and help me stay organized.

## What I learned
I learned how to create a website without a framework using vanilla javascript, html and css. This has given me fundamental skills in web development, and has helped me create more complex projects.

## Usage
Visit the app at [Time Buddy](https://timebuddy.emrymcgill.com/)


## Feedback
I am always looking to learn and improve so please feel free to give me feedback on what I can do better.
